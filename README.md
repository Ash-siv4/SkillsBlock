# SkillsBlock

SkillsBlock is a community for like-minded individuals to come together and benefit from free learning which includes live sessions (workshops) as well as additional resources (content). 

The content is made up of courseware, labs/exercises and projects.

Initially, SkillsBlock will be running two types of workshops, one on Python and the other on Blockchain. 

The content for both is can be found in their subsequent folders in this repository.
